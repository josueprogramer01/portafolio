## 📁 Folder structure

-   `/public`: publicly accessible contents (ex: images, media).
-   `/src`: all the components used in this project.
    -   `/src/components/`: each reusable components of each pages.
    -   `/src/data`: configurations of the web app.
    -   `/src/pages`: pages that include in the web app.

## ⚙️ Configurations

Since this is a public and open source project, you can make any changes to it. If you are a ReactJS developer you can do it easily. But if you are a beginner, I have extracted the configurable data into a single directory, so you can edit the files in that directory to configure the entire web application.

Directory: `/src/data/`

-   `user.js`

    From this you can change the content of each page of the web application.

-   `articles.js`

    From this you can add your articles to the web application.

-   `seo.js`

    The SEO.js file is a module that contains an array of objects, with each object representing metadata for a specific page of a React website. The purpose of this file is to centralize and manage the SEO (Search Engine Optimization) information for different pages.

    Each object in the SEO array has the following properties:

    `page`: Represents the page name or identifier. It helps in mapping the SEO data to the appropriate page.

    `title`: Specifies the title of the page. This title is typically displayed in the browser's title bar and is an important element for search engines.

    `description`: Provides a concise and informative description of the page content. This description is often displayed in search engine results and can greatly influence click-through rates.
    keywords: Contains an array of keywords relevant to the page's content. Keywords can help search engines understand the topics covered on the page and can impact its visibility in search results.
    By storing the SEO information in the SEO.js file, you can easily manage and update the metadata for different pages of your React website. This approach allows you to keep the SEO data separate from the components and reuse it across the application, ensuring consistent and optimized metadata for each page.

-   `styles.css`

    From this you can change the font colors and font families of the web application.

    ```css
    :root {
    	/* ------- colors ------- */
    	--primary-color: #27272a;
    	--secondary-color: #65656d;
    	--tertiary-color: #acacb4;
    	--quaternary-color: #e4e4e7;
    	--link-color: #14b8a6;
    	/* ---------------------- */

    	/* ------- fonts ------- */
    	--primary-font: "Heebo", sans-serif;
    	--secondary-font: "Roboto", sans-serif;
    	/* --------------------- */
    }
    ```
